# Linux Bash Navigation Lab

## Skills Demonstrated
- Navigating the Linux file system using Bash shell commands.
- Exploring directory structures with `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`.
- Reading file contents using `cat` and `head`.

## Lab Example

In one lab exercise, I performed the following tasks:

1. **Navigated to the analyst's home directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/analyst
   ```

2. **Listed all subdirectories and files:**
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

3. **Explored further into specific subdirectories (`reports/users` and `logs`):**
   ```bash
   cd reports/users
   ls
   cd ../../logs
   ls
   ```

4. **Read and previewed file contents (e.g., `Q1_added_users.txt`):**
   ```bash
   cat Q1_added_users.txt
   head Q1_added_users.txt
   ```

## Summary

These tasks demonstrate my proficiency in efficiently navigating and exploring Linux directory structures, managing files, and utilizing essential Bash commands in practical scenarios.
